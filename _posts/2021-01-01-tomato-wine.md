I posted this over a decode ago at a site now lost to Internet bitrot, and I cannot remember or find the original source. While I had intended to make this, I did not. You have been warned!

## Medium Dry Tomato Wine

  
4 quarts unpeeled tomatoes  
1 gallon boiling water  
2 lemons, sliced thinly  
2 oranges, sliced thinly  
3 lbs sugar  
yeast (1 packet of wine yeast)  
  
Pot/Crock or large pickle jar  
Strainer/Cheesecloth  
Large Saucepan  
Fermentation Jar or pail with airlock  
Siphon  
  
Place the fruits in the crock. Pour the boiling water over top. Bruise well with a wooden spoon or squeeze it well with your hands. Repeat each day for 3 days.

Strain the liquid into a large saucepan. Warm to lukewarm, stirring in the sugar until it is all dissolved.

Remove from heat. Add the yeast. Note, that even though this batch is only a few gallons, use a full-dose packet ([https://blog.eckraus.com/how-much-wine-yeast-to-use](https://blog.eckraus.com/how-much-wine-yeast-to-use "https://blog.eckraus.com/how-much-wine-yeast-to-use")).

Ferment in a dedicated jar, carboy, or pail, with an airlock. This setup is similar to any wine or beer fermentation. When the liquid has clarified, siphon into bottles, avoiding the lees at the bottom.

Age for one or two years.
