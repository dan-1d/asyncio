# DLG Intro

A radio controlled (R/C) Discus-launched Glider (DLG) is thrown by the pilot from a wingtip to heights of up to 260 feet. The pilot then controls it, searching for lift in the air -- namely, thermals (rising warm air) and object-induced lift (wind hitting a hill and going upwards). There are contests (competitions) that test pilots' skill in finding this lift, strategies, and launch technique. For more information on R/C aircraft in general, please see [https://www.modelaircraft.org/](https://www.modelaircraft.org/ "https://www.modelaircraft.org/")

# Acquiring

DLGs are most often constructed as high-performance aircraft, typically hand-built in the numbers of "dozens per year" by each manufacturer (of a few people in total size). They are expensive to the uninitiated, with new models ranging in price from USD$680 to $1000. Luckily, most pilots new to the hobby buy a previously-loved used model for between $250-$500. The floor price rarely drops below this, so they are often resold after the addition takes hold.

A few bold individuals decide to create their own DLG from scratch. This is not for the faint-of-heart, but is certainly possible!
