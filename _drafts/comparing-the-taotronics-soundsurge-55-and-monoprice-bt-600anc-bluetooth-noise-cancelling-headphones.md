## Comparing the TaoTronics Soundsurge 55 and Monoprice BT-600ANC Bluetooth Noise-cancelling headphones

I needed headphones for use at work. The primary goals, in order of importance:

1. Comfortable
2. Quality of microphone for use during meetings
3. (active) noise cancelling (ANC) or isolation
4. wireless for easy use with both phone (music) and work laptop (meetings)

I narrowed my search down to fairly inexpensive bluetooth headphones with ANC and, critically, [cVc 8.0](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/features/cvc-noise-cancellation-technology "cVc 8.0") for better isolation of my own voice during meetings. I tried:

* TaoTronics SoundSurge 55
* Monoprice BT-600ANC

## TaoTronics Soundsurge 55

My first try was the TaoTronics Soundsurge 55. Overall, these seemed like a good choice. They paired easily, buttons felt good, sound quality was acceptable. I used them for several days, but the comfort was not there, at least for my head and ear shape. I got hot spots after several hours, and the horizontal pressure was quite high. I think the cavity for ears is just a few millimeters too small, probably in the vertical direction, and perhaps depth, too. This could also be due to the lack of a "horizontal axis" of rotation for each ear cup -- they are fixed, and only rotate around the "vertical axis" when pressing into the head.

I would rate the noise cancelling quite good. It doesn't block human voices totally, but mutes most any other sounds.

Build quality felt decent. I love the tactile button feel. However, I always pushed buttons when grabbing the headphones to remove or reposition -- they felt placed a bit wrong for my habits. 

## Monoprice BT-600ANC

My second try was the Monoprice BT-600ANC. Monoprice is a long-time player in home audio equipment, even though they are not extremely well-known outside of some internet circles. The BT-600ANC seems relatively new, and I couldn't find reviews about it. Nevertheless, I took the chance.

These were immensely comfortable. My ears felt much happier!

Touch pad sometimes doesn't sense double tap to pause. Very loud and obnoxious voice when changing modes. Volume controls don't work in zoom.
